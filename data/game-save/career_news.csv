Two teams from opposite sides of the tracks clash in the league as West Brom and Cambridge Utd go head to head in this mid season game. Cambridge Utd may have had the better of things in the league this season so far but this game provides a chance for West Brom to give their fans something to cheer about and begin to climb the table with a win.\n\nFans of both teams should be excited to see today's matchup after the cracking match that saw Cambridge Utd come away with a narrow 3 - 2 victory over West Brom.\n\nThorne will have to apply the pressure on his lads in today's match to pull them from their recent slump. We've got the potential to win this match coming up began the Cambridge Utd manager we need to get an early goal and ease some of this pressure that's been building on the lads. Tony Pulis will be desperate to buoy his team's recent lukewarm performances with a win against Thorne and his lads at Cambridge Utd. Tony Pulis will need to prepare his West Brom players well for their next match. Understanding the opposition will surely be the focus of the team's tactics in an attempt to keep out Cambridge Utd and win the game. \n\nOne Cambridge Utd defender has taken Tony Pulis's eye and that is centre back Isaac Baker who has been in sparkling form at the back showing that good positional play and full dedication to winning the ball that has been invaluable to his team. He's been a rock at the back for them and his quality really emanates through the team raising everyone's performances said the West Brom boss. I've been working with my forwards on the training ground and I think we might have him sussed.\n\nWithout a doubt Tony Pulis's biggest concern will be the performance of opposition player Will Edwards. Currently the league leader in goals Edwards's recent form should give his supporters confidence to expect at least one goal from the Cambridge Utd man today.\n\nThose who watched West Brom's last match will know not to expect 24 year old Asier Villalibre to make an appearance after his sending off in that game. West Brom fans will be worried that without their star striker they might not have it in them to walk away with the win.\n\nPredicted West Brom Starting Line-up:\nŠimić Riley Vallejo Rakitskyi Lazaar Barry Elis Pedrinho Horta Gray Maolida\n\nPredicted Cambridge Utd Starting Line-up:\nCox Alexander Lewis Baker Lee Allen Cooper Duarte Asensio Mbappé Bell,Premier League Preview: West Brom vs Cambridge Utd,255,-1,0,1,16,1944,524287,3,20220301,1,1944,109,280444,0,0,0,1

The very specific skill set required to excel as a defensive midfielder is seemingly proving no problem to Fenerbahçe youngster Soner Dabanli.\nStanding at 178 cm the naturally left-footed player has caught the eye of many scouts and envious opposition coaches recently and given the 18-year-old can also play elsewhere in the middle of the park he seems certain to be in demand from a wide range of clubs.

It's Cambridge Utd who have won this year's Carabao Cup.

It's going to be a fascinating cup final this year and one where both teams will feel that they have a great chance of lifting the famous old trophy. Southampton's fans are sure that this is going to be their year to get their hands on the cup but equally Cambridge Utd's supporters are bullish about their chances too. Cambridge Utd are the favourites to triumph although by no means do Southampton go into the final without hope. So it could be a competitive final and if Southampton could get their noses in front you never know they might just be able to hang on and take the trophy home come the end of the game. Mauricio Pellegrino will need to prepare his Southampton players well for their next match. Understanding the opposition will surely be the focus of the team's tactics in an attempt to keep out Cambridge Utd and win the game. \n\nMauricio Pellegrino is sure to have noticed a string of outstanding performances from the cat like reflexes of Cambridge Utd star Aidan Cox. His shot stopping and command of the area has shown him to be a formidable last line of defence and it will take something special to beat a player who is at the top of his game. The upcoming match against Cambridge Utd will be a stern test for the Southampton forwards who will have to be at their sharpest.\n\nWith news that Max Martin will remain injured and out of the match Cambridge Utd fans will no doubt be concerned the missing wide man might diminish their chances of victory today.\n\nPredicted Southampton Starting Line-up:\nCardinale Aurier Šimunović Mammana Marušić Romeu García Boufal Rose Luis Alberto Kramarić\n\nPredicted Cambridge Utd Starting Line-up:\nCox Alexander Morris Baker Davis Cardona Rovira Naval Costa Eduardo Duarte Asensio Bell Mbappé,Carabao Cup Final Preview: Southampton vs Cambridge Utd,255,-1,0,1,16,1944,524287,3,20220227,1,1944,17,-1,0,2,0,1
